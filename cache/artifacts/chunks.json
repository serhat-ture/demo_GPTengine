A contract must have an offer. An offer is a promise made by one party. The offer is the\nprimary substance that brings the two parties together. It could be the agent’s offer to sell an\n69\nowner’s house or the buyer’s offer to purchase the property from a seller.

If the second party makes any changes to the\ncontract or submits a counteroffer, the original contract is void. ", "[Chunk 426]\nd party makes any changes to the\ncontract or submits a counteroffer, the original contract is void. The new contract is not valid\nuntil the other party accepts it.

Another requirement to create a\nlegally binding contract is that the parties must have the\ncapacity to contract and enter the agreement of their own\nfree will. They must be of legal age and sound of mind. This\nis why contracts made with minors, the mentally disabled,\nor individuals under the influence are unenforceable and\nvoidable. Contracts formed under misrepresentation", "[Chunk 429]\nviduals under the influence are unenforceable and\nvoidable. Contracts formed under misrepresentation, fraud,\nor undue pressure are also voidable.\n• Legal Purpose. A contract cannot include illegal acts or involve fraud. It must comply with\nstatutory, common and administrative law.

When some or all of the rights\nand obligations are transferred to a third party, it is called a contract assignment.

A lease that prohibits subletting is an example of this.\nA new contract can be substituted in place of the original contract. This is called novation.

A new contract is drawn up and signed by all of the\nparties.\nContract Validity\nThere are four ways to describe the validity of a contract:\n• Valid. A valid contract meets all of the five elements of a legal and enforceable contract;\n• Void. A void contract is lacking one or more of the five elements and has no legal force or\neffect. A listing contract that lacks the names of all the co-owners is void.\n• Voidable.

A voidable contract satisfies all of the five elements on the surface, but there exist\nfactors that could make the contract legally unenforceable by one or both parties. A purchase\ncontract with a minor is voidable.\n• Unenforceable. An unenforceable contract appears to satisfy all of the five elements, but it\ncannot be enforced in court, and neither party can sue for performance.

In the event of a contract default, the innocent party has the\nright to sue for specific performance, which will legally require the other party to fulfill their contractual\nresponsibilities. In the event that some uncontrollable circumstance has rendered performance by one\nor more of the parties impossible, the contract can be voided due to a", "[Chunk 437]\ns rendered performance by one\nor more of the parties impossible, the contract can be voided due to an impossibility of performance.\nA buyer who suddenly receives a job transfer to a new state can seek to be released from the contract\ndue to an impossibility of performance.

An example of an estate in land includes ownership of a property deed or the\npossession of a lease. The rights granted to the possessor will vary depending on the type of estate\nthat has been granted to the individual.

A freehold estate gives deeded possession of real property and the\nrights and privileges that come with that possession. In the previous chapter, we discussed the bundle\nof ownership rights.

When this happens, it is called a fee\nsimple subject to a condition subsequent. If the owner does not meet the condition stipulated in the\ndeed, then ownership can be terminated, and the title will revert to the grantor or successor though a\ncourt judgment.\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION: John deeds property to his son with the contingency that he must\nobtain a four-year college degree", "[Chunk 570]\n: John deeds property to his son with the contingency that he must\nobtain a four-year college degree before the age of 30.

You will also learn how to identify the parts of a deed.\nSection 1. Title vs. Deed\nIt is common for people to use the term “deed” and “title” interchangeably, but they actually refer\nto two separate legal concepts. Title is the right of ownership to real property. The ti", "[Chunk 639]\nually refer\nto two separate legal concepts. Title is the right of ownership to real property. The title to a property\ncreates the union of the legal rights of ownership, possession, and custody. A deed is the legal\ndocument used to transfer the title from one party to another.\nIt is important to understand the difference. When a property owner says that they have “title to\nthe property,” they mean that they have the legal ownership rights to that property. If a property owner\nsays they hold the ", "[Chunk 640]\n that they have the legal ownership rights to that property. If a property owner\nsays they hold the “deed to the property,” they mean that they have the written document as proof of\ntitle.\nThe title to real property can be split into legal and equitable title. Legal title represents the actual\nlegal ownership of real property. Equitable title represents the right to obtain full ownership or an\ninterest in a property. A person holding equitable title has a financial interest and the right to bene", "[Chunk 641]\nerest in a property. A person holding equitable title has a financial interest and the right to benefit\nfrom the property. Equitable title is not true ownership, nor does it grant the right of possession.\nConsider three common situations that split the title into its legal and equitable parts:\n• Land Trust: The trustee holds the legal title to the property in their name. The beneficiaries to\nthe trust have equitable title to the property. They have a financial interest in the property and\nreap b", "[Chunk 642]\nrust have equitable title to the property. They have a financial interest in the property and\nreap benefits from the property.\n• Land Contract: Property is sold to a buyer who agrees to pay the seller periodic payments. The\nseller holds the legal title until the buyer pays for the property in full. The buyer lives on the\nproperty and benefits from the property under an equitable title.\n• Purchase Contract: When the seller accepts a purchase offer, the buyer acquires equitable\ntitle to the proper", "[Chunk 643]\nContract: When the seller accepts a purchase offer, the buyer acquires equitable\ntitle to the property. They now have a financial interest in the property. At the closing, the buyer\nwill also gain the legal title.\n110\nSection 2. Contents of a Deed\nTitle agencies and attorneys prepare deeds – not real estate agents. An agent, however, needs to\nunderstand what makes up a deed and how it conveys property. In order for a deed to become a legal\ndocument, it must be in writing. This is a requirement u", "[Chunk 644]\nerty. In order for a deed to become a legal\ndocument, it must be in writing. This is a requirement under the Statute of Frauds. There are nine\nessential elements that must be in every deed.\n1. Grantor and Grantee\nThe owner or seller is called the grantor. There can be more than one grantor. A grantor must be\nof legal age, legally competent, and of sound mind. If a person is declared legally incompetent, their\nproperty can only be conveyed with the court’s approval. The grantor’s name must be spe", "[Chunk 645]\netent, their\nproperty can only be conveyed with the court’s approval. The grantor’s name must be spelled correctly\nthroughout the deed. If the owner’s name were changed after the title was initially acquired, both\nnames would need to be on the deed. For example, if Bonnie Jones married and became Bonnie Smith,\nthen the deed should indicate both names such as “Bonnie Smith, formerly Bonnie Jones.”\nThe buyer or the receiver of the title is called the grantee. There can\nbe more than one grantee. Th", "[Chunk 646]\nThe buyer or the receiver of the title is called the grantee. There can\nbe more than one grantee. The grantee must be clearly stated on the\ndeed. They do not have to be legally competent or reached the age of\nmajority. In the case of more than one grantee, the deed should also\nstate the form of ownership, such as tenancy in common or joint\ntenancy.\n2. Consideration\nIn Chapter 7, Section 3, we learned that all legal contracts must\nhave some form of consideration. In a deed, there must also be an ", "[Chunk 647]\nned that all legal contracts must\nhave some form of consideration. In a deed, there must also be an exchange of something of value.\nUsually, consideration is stated in dollars, but if the real property is conveyed as a gift, then “love and\naffection” can be classified as consideration. The consideration section is usually introduced with the\nphrase “for good and valuable consideration of the sum of…” Because deeds become a matter of\npublic record, at times, the actual price is hidden under the p", "[Chunk 648]\nf…” Because deeds become a matter of\npublic record, at times, the actual price is hidden under the phrase “ten dollars and other valuable\nconsideration.”\n3. Granting Clause\nA granting clause or act of conveyance is the formal statement that the grantor has the intention\nto transfer the title to the grantee. The granting clause will read something like “does hereby bargain,\ngrant, deed, and convey to…” or “quits any and all claims to said premises...”.\n111\n4. Habendum Clause\nA habendum clause is ", "[Chunk 649]\nto…” or “quits any and all claims to said premises...”.\n111\n4. Habendum Clause\nA habendum clause is a Latin phrase meaning “to have and to hold,” and it describes the limits\nof the estate being granted. It often follows the granting clause. When there is a conveyance of a fee\nsimple estate, look for a statement such as “to have and to hold same, together with all the buildings,\nimprovements, and appurtenances thereto, if any, to the Grantee, its heirs, successors or assigns\nforever.” A life esta", "[Chunk 650]\nppurtenances thereto, if any, to the Grantee, its heirs, successors or assigns\nforever.” A life estate is conveyed to the buyer “for the duration of their natural life.”\n5. Legal Description\nThe legal description is a geographical description of the land. It identifies the precise location,\nboundaries, and permanent easements that are used in legal documents. The legal description\nprovides identification of precisely what is being conveyed. A street address is not a legal description.\n6.

Signature of the Grantor\nAll deeds must be signed or executed by all grantors. The grantor can also permit someone with\nthe power of attorney to sign legal documents on their behalf. This can be useful if a co-owner cannot\nbe present at the closing. Some states will require witnesses to validate the signatures.

Depending on\nstate laws and the type of ownership, a grantor’s spouse may be required to sign the deed in order to\nwaive any homestead or marital rights. In many cases, the grantee is not required to sign the deed.\n8. Acknowledgment and Recording\nAn acknowledgment is the grantor’s formal declaration that they are conveying the title voluntarily\nand that their signature is valid.

The interface that sorts and tracks the database will offer detailed\nsorting parameters.

The property being appraised is called the subject property. The person who is\nlicensed to complete an appraisal is called the appraiser.

They do not represent the seller or the buyer, and they do not work for the\nlender. They are simply hired to determine the value of a property. While brokers and\nagents are paid commissions, an appraiser is paid a flat fee that has no relationship to the\nproperty value.

Apprais", "[Chunk 1219]\n of conduct and ethical\nrequirements, along with appraisal performance standards.\nSection 3. Appraisal Value Concepts\nThe appraisal of real estate is based on the underlying principles of value. The forces\nbehind these principles establish property value. The following list highlights some of the\nmain principles of value:\n• Anticipation states that value is created by the expectation that a specific event\nwill occur. For example, the news that the area’s largest factory will be closing can\nimpac", "[Chunk 1220]\nic event\nwill occur. For example, the news that the area’s largest factory will be closing can\nimpact property values before the event occurs.\n• Conformity states that a property will achieve maximum value when the\nsurrounding properties have a similar style, condition, function, and use. For\nexample, a 5,000 square foot mansion will have less value if it is surrounded by a\nmanufactured housing park.\n• Contribution states that a property feature is only worth what it contributes in value\nto the ", "[Chunk 1221]\nrk.\n• Contribution states that a property feature is only worth what it contributes in value\nto the whole. For example, it costs $20,000 to install a heated pool in Montana,\nbut it only contributes $5,000 to the market value. Thus, the pool is only worth\n$5,000.\n• Progression states that a property of lesser value is enhanced by its proximity to\nproperties of higher value. For example, an older home in a neighborhood with\nlarger newly constructed homes will have a higher value than if it was loc", "[Chunk 1222]\nme in a neighborhood with\nlarger newly constructed homes will have a higher value than if it was located in a\nneighborhood with similar older homes.\n• Regression states that a property of greater value is negatively affected by its\nproximity to lower value properties. For example, a newer home in a neighborhood\nwith older homes will have a lower value than if it was located in a neighborhood\nwith similar newly constructed homes. Regression is the opposite of progression.\n• Increasing and Decreas", "[Chunk 1223]\nsimilar newly constructed homes. Regression is the opposite of progression.\n• Increasing and Decreasing Returns: the point that the added value of a feature,\naddition, repair, etc. is more (increasing returns) or less (decreasing or diminishing\nreturns) than the actual cost of the item.\n236\n• Substitution states that an informed buyer will not pay more for a property than the\nprice of an equally desirable substitute. For example, a buyer will not pay\n$320,000 for a townhome if they can buy the i", "[Chunk 1224]\nesirable substitute. For example, a buyer will not pay\n$320,000 for a townhome if they can buy the identical model next door for\n$285,000.\n• Supply and Demand is the amount of a product available to buyers and the\ndemand for that product which forms a relationship determining the price of that\nproduct. A buyer’s or seller’s market is based on the principle of supply and\ndemand. For example, low interest rates create a buyer frenzy that drives up list\nprices because of the increase in demand.\nHig", "[Chunk 1225]\nterest rates create a buyer frenzy that drives up list\nprices because of the increase in demand.\nHighest and Best Use\nThe most fundamental principle of real estate appraisal is the principle of highest and\nbest use. Highest and Best Use is the use of a property that is (1) physically possible, (2)\nlegally permissible, (3) economically feasible, and (4) most profitable. Every property that\nis appraised must be run through each of the four tests of highest and best use – and they\nmust be done in o", "[Chunk 1226]\nised must be run through each of the four tests of highest and best use – and they\nmust be done in order. A proposed 24-unit apartment building may be physically possible,\nbut if it is not zoned for multi-family use (not legally permissible), then it does not matter if\nit is economically feasible or the most profitable use of the site. An existing use of a\nproperty may not be its highest and best use.\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION: A two-story older home on a high-traffic road was\nrecently rezoned as of", "[Chunk 1227]\nuse.\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION: A two-story older home on a high-traffic road was\nrecently rezoned as office/service. If sold as a residence, it would only fetch\n$175,000. If it was converted into office use, then under the new zoning, it could\neasily sell for $210,000. Hence, the highest and best use is as an office building,\nnot the current use as a residence.\nSection 4.

An\nappraiser can use three different approaches to determine the value of a property. Each\napproach measures the value of the property through a different set of qualifications. The\nthree approaches are the sales comparison approach, the cost approach and the income\napproach.\nThe Sales Comparison Approach\nThe Sales Comparison Approac", "[Chunk 1229]\nhe cost approach and the income\napproach.\nThe Sales Comparison Approach\nThe Sales Comparison Approach makes a direct comparison between the subject\nproperty and other similar recent sales.

The\nadjusted sale", "[Chunk 1231]\nss than\n15 percent and the gross adjustments below 25 percent for each comparable. The\nadjusted sales prices are then used to determine a value for the subject property based\non this approach to value.\nThe Cost Approach\nThe cost approach values the subject property by estimating the cost to construct all\nthe improvements less any depreciation or obsolescence plus the value for the site.

It is only used in a residential appraisal if it\nis a rental property or if it could support a higher market value if it were rented. There are\ntwo methodologies used in residential appraisals:\n• Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM). The GRM is the ratio between a property’s market\nvalue and the annual gross income.

Even though it is a typical owner expense, it is not required for the\noperation of the property and it varies greatly between investors.

The formulas are:\nNet Operating Income ÷ Market Value = Capitalization Rate\nNet Operating Income ÷ Capitalization Rate = Market Value\n240\nReconciliation\nThe final step in completing the appraisal report is to reconcile each of the three\nvaluation methods into one single market value.
